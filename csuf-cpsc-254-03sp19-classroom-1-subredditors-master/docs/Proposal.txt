John, Sahil, and Jarod
An overview on your project / project idea.
For the group project, we chose to build a web crawler built with the open source library BeautifulSoup.
Goals of your software 
Our app will be used to scrape some content from any website and store the data in an output file.
Resources used to build your software i.e. any open source libraries used, tools used or any existing open source project. 
We will use the BeautifulSoup open source library, and the open source language tool that we will use will be done via Python.
Mention how you would use these resources in your project.
Similar to the Scrapy library, the BeautifulSoup library will give us the resources we need in order to build a web scraper, without needing to know the in-depth details of how they work
If developing from an existing project mention what new features you would add.
We will be creating our own project, so there would not be new features to add, we will however be utilizing open source libraries
